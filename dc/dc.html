<h1 style="font-size:100px;"> Detective Comics </h1>

<p class="dc">DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. since 1967. DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, and produces material featuring numerous culturally iconic heroic characters including: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Shazam, Martian Manhunter, Nightwing, Green Arrow, Hawkman, Cyborg and Supergirl.<br>

Most of their material takes place in the fictional DC Universe, which also features teams such as the Justice League, the Teen Titans, the Justice League Dark, and the Doom Patrol, and well-known villains such as Lex Luthor, Darkseid, Brainiac, The Joker, Catwoman, Ra's al Ghul, Ares, Cheetah, Professor Zoom, Sinestro, Black Manta, Ocean Master, Black Adam and Deathstroke. The company has also published non-DC Universe-related material, including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo.<br>

The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman's debut and subsequently became part of the company's name. Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, however DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters from New York to Burbank, California in April of 2015.<br>

Entrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications in autumn 1934. The company debuted with the tabloid-sized New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 with a cover date of February 1935. The company's second title, New Comics #1 (Dec. 1935), appeared in a size close to what would become comic books' standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, with slightly larger dimensions than today's.That title evolved into Adventure Comics, which continued through issue #503 in 1983, becoming one of the longest-running comic-book series. In 2009 DC revived Adventure Comics with its original numbering. In 1935, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman, created Doctor Occult, who is the earliest DC Comics character to still be in the DC Universe.<br>

Wheeler-Nicholson's third and final title, Detective Comics, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue #27 (May 1939). By then, however, Wheeler-Nicholson had gone. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld—who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News—Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics #1.

<h2 style="font-size:50px;"> History </h2>

<p class="dhistory">DC Comics is known as the king of all comic books. It has been the leader in the industry since its start many years ago. They paved their way with their styles and strategies and many other comics book industries in America followed them such as their rival Marvel Comics. The history of DC Comics has gone on to be a huge part of American culture.<br>

DC Comics were able to survive and continue to thrive even when there were times when they had gone through declining periods when comics books were losing interest. However, today they proved to be one of the most successful stories in the comic book industry and are a subsidiary of the Warner Brothers Entertainment and are also part of Time Warner too.<br>

The DC Comics made a name for themselves in 1939 as they were then founded by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson. During that time its company was known as National Allied Publications. The initials for the DC Comic books were from taken from the Detective Comic series.<br>

With that series came the rise of Batman. There was another line of comic books, known as Action Comics, which featured a new super hero named Superman. Over the years these two super heroes became quite popular and to this day they are still two of the most popular characters to ever appear in comic books and went on to spark the way for many other super heroes.<br>

There once was a time when this industry was under an attack during the 1950’s as they were not considered to be up to any American standards for any children and the younger generation too. This company did continue to keep its success during that time along with several other companies too, and covered some areas as westerns and romantic stories but it was their reemergence of the super heroes which would lead them to a huge recreation of what made them so successful in the comic book industry known as the Silver Age.<br>

It was during 1965 when the industry introduced a new super hero by the name of Flash. This character was created many years before but was brought back and updated to be placed in more popular times. This time more emotional and personal compelling stories were used along with some better storyboards and artwork which helped to liven up the character. The company did the same with all the other characters too, which included batman and superman. Then shortly afterwards the Justice League society and the Justice League of America was created.<br>

<p>
Doctor Richard Occult, a.k.a. the "Ghost Detective", is a private investigator who specializes in cases involving the supernatural, and whose recorded exploits started in 1935. But the story began 36 years earlier.<br>

On December 31, 1899, a cult intended to sacrifice two kidnapped infants to Satan. The cultists attracted the attention of the demonic Koth, who rejected the offering and killed the cultists. Zator, a disciple of the mystic cult known as the Seven, rescued the infants, and brought them to a hidden citadel. The Seven recognized mystic potential in the infants, and decided to raise them, naming them Richard Occult and Rose Psychic. When they were of age Doc proved the most adept at magic, so the Seven bestowed him with the Mystic Symbol of the Seven, and the name "Doctor Occult". On the same day, they were also told to leave the Citadel, part from Zator, and use their abilities to battle evil in the world.</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 160);"> Publication History </h2>

<p>The character first appeared in the anthology comic books series originally entitled New Fun Comics (later retitled More Fun Comics) in issue #6 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in October 1935 as one of the first depicted superheroes published by DC Comics and in American comic books predating even Superman in publication. He was depicted as a supernatural detective, whose detecting style was very much in the style of Sam Spade, only with supernatural abilities with a supporting character named Rose Psychic. Writers such as Les Daniels and others cited the character as what would be a prototype of Superman.<br>

He also appeared in Centaur Publications' The Comics Magazine #1 under the name "Dr. Mystic". This was the same character because his story, "The Koth and the Seven", began in The Comics Magazine and continued in DC's More Fun Comics #14–17 (issues also designated as vol. 2, #2–5). In this story, he travels to a mystic realm where he flies and wears a cape, making him the first caped comic book superhero. Doctor Occult made his last Golden Age appearance in More Fun Comics #32 in 1938 until being resurrected in publication nearly fifty years later in All-Star Squadron, a title set during World War II and settled in Earth-Two that was written in 1985. The fictional character’s origin was that on New Year's Eve, 1899, Occult and Rose Psychic had been rescued by a shadowy group called "The Seven" from ritual murder at the hands of a Satanic cult. The two were later trained in the use of occult magics themselves. Thirty-six years later, Doctor Occult opened up his own detective agency, specializing in crimes of a mystical nature, and during World War II he joined the All-Star Squadron. At some point, he and Rose become fused into one being. Doctor Occult has used sorcery to halt or greatly slow the aging process, so that he appears in modern comics to still be a man in his late thirties or early forties, even though he was born at the end of the 19th century.<br>

He later appeared in crossover comics such as Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986), Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic (1991), The Trenchcoat Brigade (alongside Mister E, the Phantom Stranger, and John Constantine) (1999) and "Day of Judgement".<br>

<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 160);"> Sentinels of Magic </h2>

<p style="width:1000px;float:left;">Doctor Occult is one of the Sentinels of Magic, a group created to prevent artifacts such as the Spear of Destiny falling into the wrong hands.<br>

He/She plays a vital role in the Day of Judgement incident, helping to protect Earth from a full demonic invasion. Hell itself has emptied of demons and Earth was in danger from Asmodel, a fallen angel who had stolen the power of the Spectre. Battling on ravaged city streets, Occult works with other heroes, such as Katana, Batman, Phantom Stranger and Ragman but he specifically tries to protect Madame Xanadu. She had stolen some of Asmodel's power, weakening him considerably, and was hiding it behind a forcefield.<br>

He would later be affected by the Spectre again. Confused and hostless, the Spectre destroys the "Rock of Eternity" scattering fragments all over Gotham City. Several dozen mystically attuned heroes, including Doctor Occult, Phantom Stranger, Detective Chimp and Rex the Wonder Dog work together to free Gotham City from its demonic influence. Occult is briefly possessed by one of the semi-sentient "Seven Sins of Man", which had been imprisoned in the Rock for some time. Soon, Gotham, and Occult are both cleared of demonic influence.<br>

In the limited series JLA: Black Baptism (May–August 2001), Doctor Occult assists the JLA in battling a group of demons who stylize themselves after American mafia/gangsters. Partly motivated by revenge, they go after the Sentinels of Magic and other entities who have assisted in the "Day of Judgement" incident. Occult is forced to go on the run, hiding as Rose in a magical hangout, 'the Scrap Bar'. He is attacked by three of the Diablos, who take the opportunity to try to kill the other magicians. Wonder Woman and Green Lantern rescue him and subdue the demons. He soon helps heal Superman, who had been injured by a magical "worm-bullet".<br>

Doctor Occult later becomes a JSA reservist.
